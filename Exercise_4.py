# Write a function that receives two inputs, a string and a character.
# The function will return a new string equal to the input string without 
# any occurrences of the character.
# Example: string = "hello, I'm happy.", char = "l", output = "Heo I'm happy."
# Don't use .replace().
def stringSplit(string, char):
    return

IMPORTANT
You can access the individual elements of a string as if the string was a tuple (strings are also immutable).
For example:

    myString = "hello"

myString[0] would be equal to h, myString[1] would be equal to e and so on. 

You can also access portions of the string using slices (as in lists and tuples)

mystring[0:3] would be equal to "hel"

This means that you can also use a string in a for loop as if it was a list:

for letter in myString:
    print(letter)

This code would output every letter in the string individually.

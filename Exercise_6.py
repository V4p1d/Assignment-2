# Write a function that receives two strings as an input. The second input is optional 
# and by default will be equal to "odd". 
# The function will return a string, equal to the input string except, if the second input is equal to
# "odd", the elements of the string with odd indeces will be removed whereas if the second input is equal
# to "even", the elements of the string with even indeces will be removed. For this exercise, treat index 0
# as even.
# Example: string1 = "Oblivious", string2 = "odd", output = "Olvos"
# Example: string1 = "Oblivious", string2 = "even", output = "biiu"
# Remember that in order to have inputs equal to certain values by default
# they can be added to the lists of inputs in the format "input = odd".

IMPORTANT
You can access the individual elements of a string as if the string was a tuple (strings are also immutable).
For example:

    myString = "hello"

myString[0] would be equal to h, myString[1] would be equal to e and so on. 

You can also access portions of the string using slices (as in lists and tuples)

mystring[0:3] would be equal to "hel"

This means that you can also use a string in a for loop as if it was a list:

for letter in myString:
    print(letter)

This code would output every letter in the string individually.
